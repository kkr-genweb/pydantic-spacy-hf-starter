## Instructions Pasted in from o3 (starting from blank repo)

Below is a starter project that cleanly showcases Pydantic AI + spaCy + Hugging Face in a way that is small enough to finish in a weekend yet still solves a problem you can demo to clients or investors.

1  Project summary

“Smart Ticket Triage Agent” – turn raw customer-support e-mails into a validated JSON object that your CRM or help-desk software can route automatically.

Input	Output (validated by Pydantic)
Free-form e-mail text	json { "customer_id": "C12345", "product": "Widget-X", "sentiment": "negative", "urgency": "high", "entities": [{...}], "summary": "...", "next_action": "escalate_to_tier_2" }

Why it matters
	•	Ops ROI – cut manual triage time by 70 - 90 %.
	•	Risk – angry customers are flagged in minutes instead of hours.
	•	Extensible – same pipeline works for social-media DMs, chat logs, etc.

2  Tech stack rationale

Layer	Library	Role
Agent orchestration	Pydantic AI	Manage prompt flow & guarantee structured output
Entity extraction	spaCy v3 + spaCy-Transformers	Pull entities like order numbers, dates, products; shares HF backbone with classifier
Text classification	Hugging Face Transformers (e.g. distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english for sentiment; any multi-label model for urgency/topic)	Fast plug-and-play models with good accuracy

Pydantic AI gives you the same “schema-first” ergonomics FastAPI brought to web dev, but for LLM agents, so you can trust that every field is present, typed, and range-checked before it hits downstream code.  ￼

4  Implementation checklist

Phase	Key steps	Tips
A. Environment	uv venv venv && source venv/bin/activateuv pip install "pydantic-ai[examples]" spacy[transformers] transformers torch	UV handles lock-file & wheels across CPU/GPU targets.
B. spaCy model	```bash	
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf             # small demo		
python -m spacy init config cfg.cfg –pipeline ner,textcat_multilabel,transformer		
```	Use spacy-llm later if you want GPT-style functions.	
C. HF classifier	```python	
from transformers import pipeline		
sentiment = pipeline(“sentiment-analysis”, model=“distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english”)		

| **D. Pydantic schema** | ```python  
class Ticket(BaseModel):  
    customer_id: str  
    product: str  
    sentiment: Literal["positive","neutral","negative"]  
    urgency: Literal["low","medium","high"]  
    entities: List[Entity]  
    summary: str  
    next_action: str  
``` | Add custom validators (e.g., clamp urgency to allowed set). |
| **E. Agent logic** | ```python  
class TriageAgent(Agent):  
    Model = OpenAIChat("gpt-4o")  # or local LLM  
    Output = Ticket  
    def system(self):  
        return "You are a support triage assistant..."  
``` | `agent.run(email_text)` returns a **validated** `Ticket`. |
| **F. API / CLI demo** | Wrap `agent.run` in FastAPI or a simple CLI for a demo. |

## 5  Expected outcomes & evaluation

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Schema-valid output rate** |  ≥ 99 % | Unit test: send 1 000 e-mails, assert no `ValidationError`. |
| **Entity precision / recall** | > 0.85 / 0.80 | Annotate 100 e-mails, compare spaCy output. |
| **Routing accuracy (sentiment × urgency)** | > 90 % | Confusion matrix vs. human triage labels. |
| **Latency** | < 1 s on GPU, < 3 s CPU | `time.perf_counter()` around full pipeline. |

---

## 6  Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mis-classification of urgent tickets | SLA breach | Confidence thresholds + human-in-the-loop fallback |
| PII leakage via LLM logging | Compliance fines | Strip PII before logging; use encrypted storage |
| Model drift over time | Accuracy loss | Schedule quarterly re-training; plug in HF AutoTrain |
| GPU memory clash between spaCy & HF | OOM errors | Use shared model weights (`spacy-transformers`) and `torch.set_grad_enabled(False)` during inference |

## 7  Why this project is a strong “hello-world” for Pydantic AI

1. **Clear economic payoff** – immediate reduction in support overhead.  
2. **Small, public data** – you can prototype with Zendesk-sample tickets or Enron e-mails in hours.  
3. **Showcases each library’s strength** without overlapping functionality.  
4. **Easily demo-able** – run `uv run triage.py < sample.txt` and display the JSON.

Once the skeleton works, you can iterate: add multilingual support, fine-tune with `spacy train`, replace HF model with a local Llama 3 via Ollama, or connect Pydantic AI’s MPC runner for agent self-evaluation.

Happy hacking – this project is minimal yet production-flavored, and it will teach you exactly where Pydantic AI, spaCy, and Hugging Face each shine.
